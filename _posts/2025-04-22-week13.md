**Update On Oppia Progress**
I was able to make a lot of progress on my Oppia Contributions. I finally learned how the frontend unit tests worked and was able to develop and debug my own, which felt super rewarding. I submitted the PR and got a LGTM, so I'm just waiting for some final checks. I have unfortunately realized that the other issue I was assigned might be a bit above my level. I've spent many several hour sessions trying to figure it out, but to no avail. I might have to give up on it which is a same because I sunk so many hours into it.

I now have to begin locating new issues or finding my own since I now have pretty much nothing on the docket.
