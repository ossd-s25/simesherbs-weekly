title: Week 1; What is open source?
---


Generally when I think of "open source" I think of projects that are free and serve smaller communities. 
The reason I wanted to join this class is because I've always wanted to contribute to various open
source projects, but I wasn't familiar with the workflow and it always seemed too daunting.

One of my most frequently used open source projects is a Nintendo Gamecube/Wii emulator called Dolphin.
I'm a big fan of older Nintendo games so I use this emulator almost every week. I also occasionally use
two music related projects: Musescore and Audacity. I guess the last project I use regularly would be Firefox.
However, I only use it when I'm on the Ubuntu partition of my PC.
