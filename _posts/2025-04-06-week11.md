title: Week 11 - Group Project Update
---

**Progress made so far**
Even though our group doesn't have a contribution merged yet, I feel like we've still made good prgoress, albeit on the margins. I myself am pretty close to getting something merged after about a dozen back and forth messages about what the best fix is. I've grown a lot more comfortable in both navigating the codebase and working with Angular. 

**Progress to be made**
It seems unlikely at this point that we will have one big issue that we collaborate on and merge before the semester ends, and that's okay. I think a good goal is for each of us to have 3-4 small/medium issues done by the end of things. I think this is doable, especially as we can be given more responsiblility once we get 2 issues merged. I am a little worried about keeping up my Oppia contributions, my personal contibutions, and the courseload for my other classes, especially as I prepare for both finals and graduation. But as part of my last push to finish college, I'm okay with putting in some extra late nights in the coming weeks (though I have already put in plenty this semester alone).

**Presentation from this week**
I thought this week's presentation was an interesting look at how being part of an open source community can bolster or even outright start one's professional career. It was nice to get the perspective of someone that had been in a very similar position as myself and was able to succeed.
