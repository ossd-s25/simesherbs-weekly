I think my group made pretty gpod progress in the assignment, given the time we had. By the end of class we had already finished parts 1-3, as well as delegated among ourselves who is doing what for part 4. Generally, we got throught the questions with little issue or friction, with everyone having a chance to speak and sharw what they think. We even helped each other figure out some small git issues that came up. 

For parts 1-3, I'd say the contributions were all about equal. When it came to part 4, I decided to just bite the bullet on doing the CONTRIBUTING.md file, since it seemed like it would be one of the more tedious ones. Not really sure what else to say about the group work. We worked well as a team.
