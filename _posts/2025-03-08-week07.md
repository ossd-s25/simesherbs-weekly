title: Week 7 - Start of Group Project
---

**Reflect on your group work so far, how did your group decide on the project, did your group hit any obstacles yet? if so, how are you planning to resolve them**

So far I think the groups been doing really well. Going into things we had no idea what project we wanted to work on. However, we've successfully whittled it down to two options: iNaturalist and Oppia. We haven't really hit any obstacles yet, but we didn't have exact consensus on which project we'd prefer. After setting up both dev environments, Chris and I thought Oppia was the better fit while Chardin still preferred iNaturalist. 

Ultimately, we decided to take the weekend to review Oppia's codebase and see how manageable it was. If it's too complex or just out of our realm of understanding, then we'll just do iNaturalist, assuming that it's not also too complex. To his credit, Chardin was fine with just going with the majoirty vote on this, which is super helpful.
