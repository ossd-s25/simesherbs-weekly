**Comment on your small contributions: how are things going, what types of contributions were you able to make? what are the biggest challenges? which contribution are you most proud of?**

Things are going fine, I think. I've still only really contributed to OpenStreetMaps and Wikipedia. I'm frankly finding it a little difficult to not just make contributions, but find more diverse places to do so. Since I'm busy with job interviews and searches, I find that the contribution aspect of this course to be the first place where my begin to falter on my weekly workload. As the semester goes on and my responibilities get more demanding, keeping up with these contributions and simply remebering to do them will be the biggest challenge.

I wouldn't say I'm 'proud' of any contribution yet, but it was nice getting to add one of my favorite local Mexican restaurants to OpenStreetMap. Not sure anyone is going to see it, but if even one person goes there because I added it to the map, I would be very happy.
